Hey everyone! My name is Bentley Settin and I am orginally from Charlotte, NC. At UNCW, I recieved an undergraduate degree in Oceanography with a minor in biology and was a four year student athlete (soccer, not volleyball)! I orginally came in freshmen year with a love for oysters and algae (and still do) but was overjoyed to be see the opportunity to combine technology and the community! Hence, I joined the COAST lab my junior year and began learning new skills and the joy of low-cost sensor development for the purpose of coastal resilience in the community. Another fun fact about my undergraduate years... I met my husband, Kevin!

Alongside science, Kevin and I love to use sports to serve our community, especially the next generation. I spent most my summers from highschool and college playing and working with the Charlotte Lady Eagles. This Gospel-centered ministry introduces people to Jesus Christ, teaches them to follow Him, and empowers them as leaders through the global environment of soccer. Here is their website! https://www.charlotteeagles.com/ladyeagles
 
Now I am a M.S. Marine Science student focusing on coastal resiliency through flood monitoring, alerting, and community engagement. As you can tell I love being emmersed in the community and creating practical solutions for real-time issues. At UNCW I am currently involved in the Graduate Women in Leadership Association and Crossway Wilmington!
