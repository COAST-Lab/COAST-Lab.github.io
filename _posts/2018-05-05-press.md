I enjoy opportunities to discuss some of what I think are the world's most pressing (environmental) issues. But, more importantly, it is critical to get scientific and engineering knowledge out of our labs and universities! Here are a few of my favorite clips. (Apologies if the links stopped working; many of the older ones have since been removed by their original posters and I can no longer find valid links.)
