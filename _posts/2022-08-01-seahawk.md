In 2022, we were awarded a multi-institution, academic/government/industry collaborative grant from the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation to use the satellite ocean color imagery from the SeaHawk-HawkEye project for high-resolution coastal water quality analyses. 

Check out the (open-access) paper describing the resulting data here: [High-resolution ocean color imagery from the SeaHawk-HawkEye CubeSat mission](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04076-4).
